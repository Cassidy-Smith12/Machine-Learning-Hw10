 Exercise 1:
 Given the following source code: Lec37.0_CNN_MNIST_withWeights.py, modify the architecture
 of the CNN by adding CNN layers. Report the new training, validation and test accuracy.

 Exercise 2:
 In continuation of Ex. 1, predict the classification outcome of two handwritten digits. Print
 the images as well as the predictions.

 Exercise 3:
 Given the following datasets: train.zip and validation.zip, and the accompanying source code:
 Lec37.1_CNN_cats+dogs.py. This a CNN that classifies images between cats and dogs. Modify
 the number of EPOCHS to a larger value. Report whether the accuracy improves. In addition,
 predict the classification outcome of two images, one cat and one dog. Print the images as well
 as the predictions. The two images should not be from the datasets.
